# Tests Requiring Implementation

This document lists all tests that cannot currently be executed because they depend on functionality that has not been implemented yet.

**Last Updated**: After comprehensive analysis of the codebase

## Update Summary

After investigation, many functions previously thought to be missing are actually implemented:
- ✅ All string functions (string-format, string-repeat, etc.) are implemented in strings_extended.rs
- ✅ VM-stdlib integration works correctly for higher-order functions
- ✅ Basic math operations are fully implemented
- ❌ Some math functions (quotient, remainder) are missing
- ❌ Symbol type is not implemented in the VM
- ⚠️ Some functions require VM callback integration (already have stubs)

## 1. Math Functions (fluentai-stdlib)

### Location: `fluentai-stdlib/tests/math_tests.rs`

| Function | Status | Description | Implementation Needed |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| `quotient` | ❌ Missing | Integer division quotient | `(quotient 17 5) => 3` |
| `remainder` | ❌ Missing | Integer division remainder | `(remainder 17 5) => 2` |

**Note**: `modulo` is implemented as "mod" in core.rs

## 2. Functions Requiring VM Callback Integration

These functions have stub implementations that return "VM integration required" error:

### Location: `fluentai-stdlib/src/core.rs`

| Function | Line | Description | Current Status |
|----------|------|-------------|----------------|
| `map` | ~20 | Apply function to list elements | Stub returns error |
| `filter` | ~21 | Filter list by predicate | Stub returns error |
| `fold` | ~22 | Fold list with function | Stub returns error |

### Location: `fluentai-stdlib/src/collections.rs`

| Function | Description | Current Status |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `list-partition` | Partition list by predicate | Stub returns error |

**Note**: These functions actually work in the VM through the stdlib_bridge.rs implementation!

## 2. VM Stdlib Integration

### Location: `fluentai-vm/tests/iot_demo_test.rs`

All tests are marked with `#[ignore = "Stdlib functions not properly loaded"]`:

| Test | Line | Issue |
|------|------|-------|
| `test_basic_iot_functionality` | 9 | Uses `list`, `filter`, `length` functions |
| `test_sensor_reading_simulation` | 33 | Uses `list`, `car`, `cdr`, `filter`, `length` functions |
| `test_pipeline_concept` | 66 | Uses `list`, `map`, `filter`, `length` functions |
| `test_fold_operations` | 91 | Uses `list`, `fold`, `length`, division operator |

**Update**: After investigation, the VM-stdlib integration actually works correctly. The tests may have been marked as ignored due to:
1. Previous build issues that have been resolved
2. Missing specific functions like `list` constructor or arithmetic operators
3. The tests haven't been re-enabled after fixes were made

**Action Needed**: Remove the `#[ignore]` attributes and run the tests to see which specific functions are missing.

## 3. Symbol Type Support

### Location: `fluentai-stdlib/tests/symbol_tests.rs`

The entire symbol test suite cannot run because:
- The VM doesn't have a Symbol value type
- Parser doesn't distinguish between symbols and strings
- No symbol literal syntax support (e.g., `'symbol`)

## 4. Parser Validation

### Location: `fluentai-parser/tests/iot_demo_validation.rs`

| Issue | Line | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Special form validation | 91 | Parser doesn't validate argument counts for `define`, `lambda`, etc. |

## 5. Type System Features

### Location: `fluentai-types/src/inference_tests.rs`

Tests that may fail due to incomplete implementation:

| Feature | Test | Line | Status |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| Module inference | `test_module_inference` | 306 | Partial - module type inference not complete |
| Import inference | `test_import_inference` | 323 | Partial - import resolution not implemented |
| Contract inference | `test_contract_inference` | 353 | Partial - contract specifications not supported |
| Effect handlers | `test_effect_handler_operations` | 419 | Partial - effect handler syntax not fully supported |

## 6. Compiler/Optimizer Issues

### Location: Various optimizer files

| Issue | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Stack overflow | `fluentai-contracts/tests/evaluator_tests.rs` | Optimizer causes stack overflow on certain patterns |
| Tail call detection | `fluentai-vm/src/compiler.rs` | Tail call optimization not working correctly |
| Loop optimization | `fluentai-optimizer/src/advanced_optimizer.rs` | Loop detection and transformation incomplete |

## 7. Contract System

### Location: `fluentai-contracts/tests/`

Many contract tests are incomplete because:
- Contract evaluation is not integrated with VM
- Symbolic execution is not implemented
- Bounded model checking is stubbed

## Summary of Actually Missing Features

After comprehensive analysis, far fewer features are missing than initially thought:

1. **Math Functions**: Only 2 functions missing
   - `quotient` - Integer division quotient  
   - `remainder` - Integer division remainder

2. **Symbol Type**: Not implemented in VM
   - No Symbol value variant
   - No symbol literal syntax ('symbol)
   - No symbol->string conversion

3. **Parser Validation**: 
   - Special forms don't validate argument counts

4. **List Constructor**:
   - No `list` function in stdlib (relies on VM literal syntax)

5. **Advanced Features** (Lower Priority):
   - Contract system integration
   - Loop optimizations  
   - Module/import type inference
   - Effect handler full syntax support

## Immediately Actionable Items

### Can Be Fixed Now:
1. **Math functions** - Add quotient and remainder to math.rs
2. **Enable IoT tests** - Remove #[ignore] from iot_demo_test.rs and see what actually fails
3. **List function** - Add simple list constructor to core.rs

### Requires More Work:
1. **Symbol type** - Add to VM value types
2. **Parser validation** - Add arity checking for special forms

## Tests That Can Be Enabled

These tests are marked as ignored but might actually work:
- `fluentai-vm/tests/iot_demo_test.rs` - All 4 tests
- String tests that are commented out (functions are implemented)

## Corrections to Previous Understanding

1. ✅ **String functions ARE implemented** - string-format, string-repeat, etc. exist in strings_extended.rs
2. ✅ **VM-stdlib bridge DOES work** - map, filter, fold work through stdlib_bridge.rs
3. ✅ **Higher-order functions ARE supported** - Special handling in VM for __stdlib__ functions
4. ❌ **Only 2 math functions missing** - quotient and remainder
5. ❌ **Symbol type is the main gap** - Affects multiple test suites
