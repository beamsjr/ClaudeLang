# FluentAI Async/Await Implementation Status

## Summary

I tested the async/await functionality in FluentAI and found the following:

### What Works ✅

1. **Channels**
   - `(chan)` creates a channel and returns `#<channel:id>`
   - Channel IDs are properly tracked

2. **Send/Receive**
   - `(send! channel value)` sends a value to a channel
   - `(recv! channel)` receives a value from a channel
   - Basic channel communication works synchronously

3. **Spawn**
   - `(spawn expr)` creates a goroutine
   - Returns a promise ID as `#<promise:id>`
   - The spawned code executes asynchronously

4. **Async blocks**
   - `(async expr)` syntax is recognized
   - Currently executes the body immediately (not truly async)
   - Does NOT return a promise

### What Doesn't Work ❌

1. **Await**
   - `(await promise)` has a bug - tries to resolve "promise:promise:1"
   - Cannot properly wait for spawned tasks to complete

2. **True Async/Await**
   - `async` doesn't create promises
   - No proper async context or continuation support
   - Cannot chain async operations

3. **Complex Async Patterns**
   - No async function definitions
   - No proper error handling for async operations
   - Limited concurrent programming patterns

### Code Examples

Working example:
```lisp
;; Create and use a channel
(let ((ch (chan)))
  (begin
    (send! ch "Hello")
    (recv! ch)))  ; Returns "Hello"

;; Spawn a task
(spawn (lambda () (print-line "Running async")))  ; Returns #<promise:1>
```

Not working:
```lisp
;; Await doesn't work properly
(await (spawn (lambda () 42)))  ; Error: Unknown identifier: 'promise:promise:1'

;; Async doesn't create promises
(await (async 42))  ; Error: expected promise, got int
```

### Implementation Notes

From examining the code:

1. The compiler's `compile_async` method just compiles the body directly without creating async context
2. The VM has promise and channel support, but await has a bug in identifier handling
3. The parser recognizes all async/await syntax correctly
4. The effect system has async effect types defined but not fully integrated

### Conclusion

FluentAI has **partial async support**:
- Basic concurrency primitives (channels, spawn) work
- True async/await with promises is not fully implemented
- The infrastructure is in place but needs completion

To have full async/await support, the following would need to be implemented:
1. Fix the await identifier bug
2. Make `async` create actual promises
3. Implement proper async function definitions
4. Add async/await continuation support in the VM
