# FLC Syntax Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation status of FLC (Fluent Lambda Chain) syntax features based on the language design document in CLAUDE.md.

## Already Implemented (Discovered)
The following features were already implemented in the parser before this task:
- ✅ Map literals: `{"key": "value"}`
- ✅ Set literals: `#{1, 2, 3}`
- ✅ Import aliases: `use module::path as alias`
- ✅ Destructuring in let bindings: `let {x, y} = point`
- ✅ Optional chaining: `obj.?method()`

## Newly Implemented
The following features were implemented during this task:

### 1. For Loops
```flc
for item in collection { body }
```
- Translates to: `collection.for_each(item => body)`

### 2. While Loops
```flc
while condition { body }
```
- Translates to a recursive function using let-rec

### 3. Const Definitions
```flc
private const MAX_SIZE = 100
public const API_KEY = "secret"
```
- Parsed as regular defines with uppercase names
- Type system can enforce immutability later

### 4. Derive Attributes
```flc
private struct Point { x: int, y: int }.derive(Debug, Clone)
private enum Status { Active, Inactive }.derive(Debug)
```
- Supports multiple traits in a single derive
- Works for both structs and enums

## Still Not Implemented
The following features from the language design are not yet implemented:

### Low-Level Features
- Range operators: `1..10`, `1...10`
- Increment operator: `x++`
- Wildcard imports already work: `use module::*`

### Advanced Features
- Macro invocations with `!`: `println!("hello")`
- Custom macro definitions: `macro rules! { ... }`
- FFI extern blocks: `extern "C" { ... }`
- Parallel keyword: `parallel { ... }`
- Contract specifications: `@contract { ... }`
- Recursive let bindings (may have limitations)

### Type System Features
- Generic type parameters in function definitions
- Trait bounds in generics
- Type inference improvements

## Testing
All implemented features have been tested with example programs:
- `test_collections.rs` - Map and set literals
- `test_loops.rs` - For and while loops
- `test_const.rs` - Const definitions
- `test_import_alias.rs` - Import aliases
- `test_destructuring.rs` - Destructuring
- `test_optional_chaining.rs` - Optional chaining
- `test_derive.rs` - Derive attributes
- `test_comprehensive.rs` - All features together

## Code Locations
- Parser implementation: `fluentai-parser/src/flc_parser.rs`
- Lexer tokens: `fluentai-parser/src/flc_lexer.rs`
- Test files: `fluentai-parser/examples/test_*.rs`

## Notes
1. Map and set literals translate to function calls (make_map, make_set)
2. For loops translate to for_each method calls
3. While loops translate to recursive functions
4. Derive attributes are stored as metadata (will need backend support)
5. All syntax features parse correctly but may need additional work in later compilation phases
