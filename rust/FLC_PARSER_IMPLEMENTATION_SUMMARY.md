# FLC Parser Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented major FLC (Fluent Lambda Chain) parser features to support migration from s-expression syntax to modern FLC syntax.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Variable Mutation Support ✓
- Added `:=` operator for variable mutation
- Supports both `=` and `:=` for assignments
- Works in both top-level and block contexts
- Example: `{ let x = 10; x := 20 }`

### 2. Standard Library Functions ✓
- Stdlib functions already available in VM
- Functions like `print`, `println`, `concat` accessible globally
- Parser creates Variable nodes for function references
- VM handles resolution of stdlib functions

### 3. Effect Statement Syntax ✓
- Added `perform` keyword for effect operations
- Syntax: `perform IO.print("Hello")`
- Supports all effect types: IO, State, Error, Async, Time, Network, Random, Dom, Concurrent
- Multiple effects can be performed in sequence

### 4. Module System with Exports ✓
- Added `export` keyword and export parsing
- Syntax: `export { name1, name2 as alias }`
- Modules can declare exports within their body
- Export statements can appear at top-level or within modules

### 5. Handler Expressions ✓
- Added `handle` expression for effect handling
- Syntax:
  ```flc
  handle {
      perform IO.print("Hello");
      perform State.set(42)
  } with {
      IO.print(msg) => captured.push(msg),
      State.set(value) => { current_state = value }
  }
  ```
- Handlers are compiled to lambda functions

## Not Implemented (Low Priority)

### 6. Symbol/Quote Support
- Would require changes to core AST (Literal enum)
- Not critical for basic test migration
- Could be added later if needed

### 7. Undefined Variable Reference Mode
- Testing-specific feature
- Better handled at compiler/VM level
- Not a parser concern

## Test Coverage
All implemented features have comprehensive test coverage in `flc_parser_tests.rs`:
- `test_parse_mutation` - Variable mutation
- `test_parse_effect_statements` - Effect syntax
- `test_parse_module_with_exports` - Module exports
- `test_parse_handler_expressions` - Handler expressions

## Impact
These parser enhancements enable migration of VM tests from s-expression syntax to FLC, significantly improving code readability and maintainability. The parser now supports all critical language features needed for production use.
