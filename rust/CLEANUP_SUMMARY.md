# Project Cleanup Summary

## Actions Taken

### 1. Test Files Organization
- Moved all test files (`test_*.flc`, `test_*.fc`) from `rust/` root to `tests/integration/flc_tests/`
- Moved misplaced Rust test files (`test_assignment_issue.rs`, `test_cons_nil_patterns.rs`) to `fluentai-vm/tests/`
- Moved test files from `fluentai-parser/src/` to `fluentai-parser/tests/`

### 2. Documentation Organization
Created proper directory structure for documentation:
- `docs/migration/` - Contains all migration-related documents (FLC parser, async/await status, etc.)
- `docs/reports/` - Contains issue reports and limitations documentation

### 3. File Extension Standardization
- Renamed all `.fc` files to `.flc` for consistency with the Fluent Lambda Chain (FLC) language specification
- Affected locations:
  - `examples/` directory (45 files renamed)
  - `tests/integration/flc_tests/` (5 files renamed)

### 4. Parser Cleanup
- Moved test files from parser src directory to tests directory
- No obsolete s-expression parser files were found (migration appears complete)

## Directory Structure After Cleanup

```
rust/
├── docs/
│   ├── migration/     # Migration guides and status reports
│   └── reports/       # Issue reports and limitations
├── examples/          # All example files now use .flc extension
├── tests/
│   └── integration/
│       └── flc_tests/ # All test files moved here
└── fluentai-*/       # Individual crate directories
    └── tests/         # Crate-specific tests
```

### 5. Additional Cleanup
- Created `build_artifacts/` directory for compiled test executables and legacy .cl files
- Created `coverage_reports/` directory for all coverage-related files
- Created `scripts/` directory for build scripts
- Moved additional test .rs files to `fluentai-vm/tests/`
- Moved `vm_comparison_analysis` to `docs/reports/`

## Directory Structure After Cleanup

```
rust/
├── build_artifacts/   # Compiled test executables and legacy files
├── coverage_reports/  # Coverage reports and profiling data
├── docs/
│   ├── migration/     # Migration guides and status reports
│   └── reports/       # Issue reports and analysis
├── examples/          # All example files now use .flc extension
├── scripts/           # Build and utility scripts
├── tests/
│   └── integration/
│       └── flc_tests/ # All test files moved here
└── fluentai-*/       # Individual crate directories
    └── tests/         # Crate-specific tests
```

## Files Organized
- **Test files**: 50+ test files moved from root to appropriate test directories
- **Documentation**: 20+ documentation files organized into docs/migration and docs/reports
- **Build artifacts**: 15+ compiled executables moved to build_artifacts/
- **Coverage files**: All coverage reports and profiling data moved to coverage_reports/

## Benefits
1. **Clean root directory** - Only essential files (Cargo.toml, README, Makefile) remain in root
2. **Consistent file extensions** - All FluentAI files now use .flc
3. **Organized documentation** - Easy to find migration guides and reports
4. **Proper test organization** - Tests are in appropriate test directories
5. **Separated build artifacts** - Compiled files don't clutter the source tree
