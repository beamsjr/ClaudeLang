# Async Runtime Testing Summary

## Completed Work

1. **Effect System Implementation** ✓
   - Created comprehensive effect handler framework
   - Implemented handlers for: IO, State, Error, Time, Network, Random, Dom, Async, Concurrent
   - Integrated with VM through EffectContext

2. **Async/Await Infrastructure** ✓
   - Added async opcodes: EffectAsync, Await, Spawn
   - Integrated tokio runtime
   - Created promise and channel support
   - VM can handle async operations

3. **Python Bindings** ✓
   - Fixed PyO3 linking errors on macOS
   - Bindings compile and work correctly
   - Can parse ClaudeLang code from Python

## Current Limitations

1. **Lambda Functions Not Implemented**
   - MakeFunc opcode is not implemented in the VM
   - This prevents testing of async callbacks and higher-order functions
   - Would need to implement closure support

2. **Effect Syntax in Parser**
   - The parser doesn't yet support the `(effect type:operation args...)` syntax
   - Would need to extend the parser to recognize effect expressions

3. **Full Async Testing Blocked**
   - Without lambda support, can't test:
     - Async callbacks
     - Promise chaining with `then`
     - Spawn with function arguments
     - Channel operations with producers/consumers

## Test Results

### Working Features:
- Basic arithmetic and logic operations ✓
- Let bindings ✓
- VM with effect context/runtime integration ✓
- Python bindings compilation and basic usage ✓

### Not Yet Testable:
- Async/await operations (needs lambda support)
- Effect handlers (needs effect syntax in parser)
- Concurrent operations (needs lambda + spawn)

## Recommendations

To fully test the async runtime, the following should be implemented:
1. MakeFunc opcode for lambda support
2. Effect expression parsing
3. Integration tests once both are ready

The async infrastructure is in place and ready to use once these prerequisites are met.
