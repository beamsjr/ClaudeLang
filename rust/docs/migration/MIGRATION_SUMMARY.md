# S-Expression to FLC Migration Summary

## Overview
The FluentAI project has removed s-expression parser support, requiring all tests to be migrated to FLC (Fluent Lambda Chain) syntax or rewritten to use direct AST construction.

## Migration Progress

### Successfully Migrated Tests
1. **define_tests.rs** - 7/7 tests passing
   - Simple function definitions work well in FLC
   - Syntax: `private function name(params) { body }`

2. **begin_tests.rs** - 14/21 tests passing
   - Multiple top-level expressions are supported
   - 7 tests blocked by missing features (mutation, effects, etc.)

3. **safety_test.rs** - 1 test migrated
   - Lambda syntax works: `(x) => x / 0`

4. **test_simple_pattern.rs** - Fully migrated
   - Pattern matching with or patterns works: `1 | 2 | 3 => "result"`

### Blocked Tests
1. **module_tests.rs** - Cannot migrate
   - FLC module system is incomplete
   - No export syntax, different AST structure

2. **handler tests** - Cannot migrate
   - No handler expression syntax in FLC
   - Only actor handler methods supported

3. **async_await_test.rs** - Runtime limitation
   - Cannot use block_on within tokio runtime

### Compiler Bugs Fixed
1. LoadLocal0-3 opcodes not incrementing stack_depth
2. PopN stack calculation error (was `depth - (arg - 1)`, should be `depth - arg`)
3. Lambda parameter stack initialization (must start with params.len())

## Key FLC Limitations Discovered

### Critical Missing Features
1. **No variable mutation** - No `set!` or assignment after binding
2. **Incomplete module system** - No exports, different import AST
3. **No handler expressions** - Only actor methods supported
4. **Limited effect syntax** - `effect` keyword exists but doesn't parse as statement
5. **No quote/symbol syntax** - Cannot create symbols easily
6. **Missing stdlib functions** - `print`, string concatenation, etc.

### Impact
- Many tests cannot be migrated without implementing missing features
- Some tests need complete redesign to avoid mutation
- Module and handler tests are completely blocked

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. Mark blocked tests with `#[ignore]` and explanatory comments
2. Focus on migrating tests that don't use blocked features
3. Consider implementing critical missing features (mutation, effects)

### Long Term
1. Complete FLC parser implementation for full feature parity
2. Or maintain a legacy s-expression parser for tests
3. Or rewrite all tests to use direct AST construction

## Migration Strategy
1. Start with simple tests (literals, functions, arithmetic)
2. Skip tests requiring missing features
3. Document all limitations discovered
4. Create workarounds where possible

## Lessons Learned
1. Removing legacy syntax support requires careful migration planning
2. Test suites reveal gaps in language implementation
3. Some features (mutation, modules) are fundamental for testing
4. Direct AST construction is verbose but always works as fallback
