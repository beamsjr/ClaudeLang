# Async/Await Implementation Status

## What Was Done

### 1. Fixed Await to Properly Block
Modified the Await opcode implementation in fluentai-vm/src/vm.rs:

- Changed from non-blocking try_recv() to properly blocking behavior
- First attempts a non-blocking check if promise is ready
- If not ready and an effect runtime is available, uses try_block_on to wait
- Falls back to error if no runtime is available and promise not ready

### 2. Issues Encountered

1. **Runtime Context**: The tests fail because:
   - #[tokio::test] already provides a runtime context
   - EffectRuntime::new() tries to create a new runtime, causing 'Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime' error
   - Using EffectRuntime::from_current() fixes this but the promise still isn't ready

2. **Race Condition**: The await happens immediately after spawn, and the spawned task hasn't had a chance to execute yet

3. **Test Infrastructure**: The existing spawn_integration_test.rs was also failing with the same runtime issue

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Keep Non-Blocking Behavior (Original Design)
The original implementation was non-blocking - if a promise wasn't ready, it would return the promise back. This suggests:
- Await might need to be called in a loop
- Or there's a higher-level construct that handles the retry logic

### Option 2: Fix Blocking Behavior
To make blocking await work properly:
1. Ensure spawned tasks get a chance to run before await
2. Use proper async context management
3. Consider using tokio::task::yield_now() to give other tasks a chance to run

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Use non-blocking in synchronous contexts
- Use blocking when an async runtime is available
- This is what the current implementation attempts but needs refinement

## Next Steps

1. Understand the intended semantics of await in FluentAI
2. Fix the test infrastructure to properly handle async contexts
3. Consider implementing a proper event loop or executor for the VM
4. Add comprehensive tests for various async scenarios
