# Integrate Code Coverage Reports with GitHub and Auto-Create Low Coverage Tickets

## Overview

Investigate and implement a system to automatically integrate code coverage reports with GitHub, identify areas with low test coverage, and create GitHub issues for improving test coverage in those areas.

## Motivation

- **Quality Assurance**: Automatically identify untested or poorly tested code
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Create actionable tickets for coverage improvements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Make test coverage a visible, tracked metric
- **Team Accountability**: Assign coverage improvement tasks automatically

## Research Tasks

### 1. Coverage Report Integration Options

- [ ] **GitHub Actions Integration**
  - Codecov integration
  - Coveralls integration
  - Native GitHub coverage reporting
  - Custom coverage upload actions

- [ ] **Coverage Format Support**
  - lcov format (from llvm-cov)
  - Cobertura XML
  - JaCoCo format
  - JSON coverage reports

- [ ] **PR Comment Integration**
  - Coverage diff comments on PRs
  - Coverage trend visualization
  - Line-by-line coverage annotations

### 2. Coverage Analysis Tools

```yaml
# Example GitHub Action for Rust coverage
name: Coverage
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - name: Install cargo-llvm-cov
        run: cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
      
      - name: Generate coverage
        run: cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace --lcov --output-path lcov.info
      
      - name: Upload to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          files: lcov.info
          fail_ci_if_error: true
      
      - name: Analyze coverage
        run: |
          # Custom script to identify low coverage areas
          python analyze_coverage.py lcov.info
```

### 3. Automatic Issue Creation

```python
# analyze_coverage.py - Example implementation
import json
import sys
from github import Github
from coverage_parser import parse_lcov

COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 70  # Minimum acceptable coverage
ISSUE_TEMPLATE = """
## Low Test Coverage Detected

**File**: `{file_path}`
**Current Coverage**: {coverage:.1f}%
**Target Coverage**: {threshold}%
**Uncovered Lines**: {uncovered_lines}

### Suggested Actions
1. Add unit tests for uncovered functions
2. Add integration tests for main code paths
3. Consider refactoring if code is difficult to test

### Uncovered Code Sections
{uncovered_sections}

def analyze_coverage(coverage_file):
    """Identify files/functions with low coverage."""
    coverage_data = parse_lcov(coverage_file)
    low_coverage_areas = []
    
    for file_path, file_coverage in coverage_data.items():
        if file_coverage.percentage < COVERAGE_THRESHOLD:
            low_coverage_areas.append({
                'file': file_path,
                'coverage': file_coverage.percentage,
                'uncovered_lines': file_coverage.uncovered_lines,
                'functions': file_coverage.low_coverage_functions()
            })
    
    return low_coverage_areas

def create_github_issues(low_coverage_areas, repo_token):
    """Create GitHub issues for low coverage areas."""

        existing_issues = repo.get_issues(
            state='open',
            labels=['coverage', 'automated']
        )
        
        issue_exists = any(
            f"Coverage: {area['file']}" in issue.title 
            for issue in existing_issues
        )
        
        if not issue_exists:
            issue = repo.create_issue(
                title=f"Coverage: Improve test coverage for {area['file']}",
                body=ISSUE_TEMPLATE.format(
                    file_path=area['file'],
                    coverage=area['coverage'],
                    threshold=COVERAGE_THRESHOLD,
                    uncovered_lines=len(area['uncovered_lines']),
                    uncovered_sections=format_uncovered_sections(area)
                ),
                labels=['coverage', 'automated', 'good first issue']
            )
            print(f"Created issue #{issue.number} for {area['file']}")
```

## Configuration Example

```yaml
# .github/coverage-config.yml
coverage:
  # Global settings
  global_threshold: 80
  
  # Per-directory thresholds
  thresholds:
    "src/core/": 90      # Critical code needs high coverage
    "src/experimental/": 60  # New features can have lower coverage
    "examples/": 0       # Don't require coverage for examples
  
  # Issue creation rules
  issues:
    enabled: true
    create_for_new_files: true
    create_for_regression: true
    regression_threshold: 5  # % drop that triggers issue
    
  # Assignment rules
  assignment:
    strategy: "codeowners"  # or "round-robin", "by-module"
    fallback: "@beamsjr"
    
  # Labels to apply
  labels:
    - "coverage"
    - "automated"
    - "testing"
```

## Tools to Evaluate

### Coverage Services
1. **Codecov**
   - Pros: Great GitHub integration, PR comments, trends
   - Cons: Paid for private repos
   
2. **Coveralls**
   - Pros: Simple setup, good visualizations
   - Cons: Less features than Codecov

3. **GitHub Actions + Custom**
   - Pros: Full control, no external dependencies
   - Cons: More maintenance

### Rust Coverage Tools
1. **cargo-tarpaulin**
   - Linux only but very accurate
   - Good for CI environments

2. **cargo-llvm-cov**
   - Cross-platform
   - Uses LLVM's coverage tools

3. **grcov**
   - Mozilla's tool
   - Supports multiple formats

## Success Metrics

- **Coverage Improvement**: Track overall coverage trend
- **Issue Resolution Time**: How quickly coverage issues are fixed
- **False Positive Rate**: Avoid creating unnecessary issues
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Survey team on usefulness

## Example Dashboard

## Coverage Status Dashboard

### Overall Coverage: 78.3% 📈 (+2.1%)

#### Modules Needing Attention
| Module | Coverage | Target | Issues |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| fluentai-vm | 65.2% | 80% | [#102](#), [#103](#) |
| fluentai-effects | 71.5% | 85% | [#104](#) |
| fluentai-optimizer | 89.1% | 90% | [#105](#) |

#### Recent Coverage Changes
- ✅ fluentai-parser: 82.3% → 91.2% (#98 resolved)
- ⚠️ fluentai-compiler: 77.8% → 74.2% (regression)
- ✅ fluentai-stdlib: 88.9% → 92.1% (#99 resolved)
```

## Considerations

1. **Noise Reduction**: Avoid creating too many issues
2. **Smart Grouping**: Group related coverage issues
3. **Priority Setting**: Focus on critical paths first
4. **Team Buy-in**: Ensure team sees value, not burden
5. **Customization**: Allow per-team configuration

## Priority

**Medium** - Improves code quality and maintainability over time
