# Test Summary Report

## Overall Status

### ✅ Packages with All Tests Passing:
- **fluentai-core**: 161 tests passed
- **fluentai-parser**: 226 tests passed, 6 ignored
- **fluentai-optimizer**: 67 tests passed, 3 ignored (plus additional test files)
- **fluentai-vm**: Tests compile and run
- **fluentai-types**: 96 tests passed

### ❌ Packages with Compilation Errors:
1. **fluentai-interpreter**
   - Error: `Rc<Closure>` cannot be sent between threads safely
   - Location: `async_runtime.rs:149`
   - Issue: Trying to spawn async tasks with non-Send types

2. **fluentai-stdlib**
   - Error: HashMap type mismatch in tests
   - Location: `collections_tests.rs:215`
   - Issue: Expected `FxHashMap` but got `HashMap` with RandomState

### ❌ Packages with Test Failures:

**fluentai-effects** (7 failures out of 9 tests):
1. `test_complex_effect_program` - Parse error at position 216
2. `test_concurrent_effects` - Missing Concurrent effect type
3. `test_dom_effects` - DOM effect test failure
4. `test_effect_in_loop_context` - Loop context issue
5. `test_effect_ordering_preservation` - Effect ordering issue
6. `test_effect_with_error_handling` - Missing Error effect type
7. `test_effects_with_optimizer` - Optimizer integration issue

## Code Coverage Report

Unfortunately, code coverage report generation failed due to compilation errors in some packages. To generate coverage:

1. Fix compilation errors in fluentai-interpreter and fluentai-stdlib
2. Run: `cargo tarpaulin --workspace --out Html --output-dir coverage-report`

## Recent Changes Made

### Successfully Fixed:
1. ✅ Added effect primitive detection in optimizer
2. ✅ Fixed effect analysis to detect effect primitives in function applications
3. ✅ Fixed all effect preservation tests in optimizer (updated syntax to use `(effect io:print ...)`)
4. ✅ Fixed compilation errors in advanced_optimizer.rs

### Effect Primitive Recognition:
The optimizer now recognizes these effect primitives:
- IO: print, println, display, read-line, read-file, write-file, etc.
- State: get, set, ref, deref, update!
- Error: raise, error, throw, catch
- Time: now, sleep, timeout, timer
- Random: random, int, float, seed!
- Network: http-get, http-post, connect, send, receive
- Async: async, await, spawn, join
- Concurrent: spawn, channel, send!, recv!, select, mutex
- Dom: query, create, update, remove, event

## Recommendations

1. Fix the Send trait issue in fluentai-interpreter by using Arc instead of Rc for shared state
2. Fix HashMap type issues in fluentai-stdlib tests
3. Update effect tests in fluentai-effects to use the correct syntax
4. Consider excluding problematic packages from CI until fixed
