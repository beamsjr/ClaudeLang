## Relationship to Main Documentation

This directory focuses on **implementation-specific** details for developers working on the Rust codebase. 

For general FluentAi documentation, see:
- `/docs/` - Language design, features, and user guides
- `/examples/` - User-facing examples and tutorials

## Note on MODULE_SYSTEM.md

The `MODULE_SYSTEM.md` file here contains implementation details. For the general module system documentation, refer to `/docs/MODULE_SYSTEM.md`.

## For Developers

When working on the Rust implementation:
1. Document implementation decisions here
2. Keep performance analyses up-to-date
3. Link to relevant source code using file paths
4. Coordinate with main `/docs/` for user-facing changes
