# FluentAI Feature Requests for ClaudeScope

This document tracks FluentAI features that would enhance the ClaudeScope network analyzer implementation.

## High Priority Features

### 1. Network-Specific Data Types
- **IP Address Type**: Native support for IPv4/IPv6 addresses with validation
- **MAC Address Type**: Hardware address representation
- **Port Range Type**: Efficient representation of port ranges (e.g., 1024-65535)
- **CIDR Block Type**: Network prefix notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

### 2. Binary Data Handling
- **Byte Array Type**: Efficient handling of packet payloads
- **Bit Field Access**: Extract specific bits from packet headers
- **Binary Pattern Matching**: Match against packet signatures

### 3. Concurrency Primitives
- **Async/Await**: For non-blocking packet capture
- **Channel Types**: For inter-thread communication
- **Atomic Operations**: For lock-free counters and statistics

### 4. External FFI
- **C FFI**: Interface with libpcap for packet capture
- **Rust FFI**: Better integration with Rust ecosystem
- **Callback Support**: For packet capture callbacks

### 5. Performance Features
- **Inline Hints**: Force inlining of hot path functions
- **SIMD Support**: For parallel packet processing
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: Avoid unnecessary data copies

## Medium Priority Features

### 6. Advanced Pattern Matching
- **Guard Clauses**: Pattern matching with conditions
- **View Patterns**: Transform data during pattern matching
- **Or-patterns**: Match multiple patterns in one arm

### 7. Type System Enhancements
- **Linear Types**: For zero-copy packet ownership
- **Refinement Types**: Express network invariants in types
- **Dependent Types**: Type-level guarantees about packet sizes

### 8. Standard Library Extensions
- **Hash Maps with Custom Hashers**: For efficient IP lookups
- **Bloom Filters**: For probabilistic set membership
- **Ring Buffers**: For packet buffering

### 9. Debugging Support
- **Stack Traces**: Better error reporting
- **Debug Assertions**: Runtime checks in debug mode
- **Profiling Hooks**: Performance analysis integration

## Low Priority Features

### 10. Language Sugar
- **String Interpolation**: For formatted logging
- **Numeric Literals**: Binary/hex literals for network constants
- **Custom Operators**: Define domain-specific operators

### 11. Metaprogramming
- **Compile-Time Evaluation**: Generate lookup tables
- **Code Generation**: Generate packet parsers from specs
- **Reflection**: Inspect types at runtime

## Workarounds Used

For features not yet available, we implement workarounds:

1. **IP Addresses**: Represented as tagged unions with validation functions
2. **Binary Data**: Using lists of integers with helper functions
3. **Async Operations**: Simulated with continuation-passing style
4. **FFI**: Mock interfaces with FluentAI implementations
5. **Pattern Guards**: Nested if-expressions in match arms

## Implementation Insights

After building ClaudeScope, additional observations about useful language features:

### Contract System Enhancements
1. **Contract Inheritance**: Ability to extend contracts in derived types
2. **Contract Composition**: Combine multiple contracts with logical operators
3. **Temporal Contracts**: Express properties over time (e.g., "eventually", "always")
4. **Contract Debugging**: Better error messages showing which part of contract failed

### Type System Observations
1. **Phantom Types**: For compile-time unit checking (e.g., Mbps vs Kbps)
2. **Newtype Pattern**: Zero-cost type wrappers for domain modeling
3. **Type Classes**: For ad-hoc polymorphism in network protocols
4. **Row Polymorphism**: For extensible packet headers

### Performance Considerations
1. **Tail Call Optimization**: Essential for packet processing loops
2. **Unboxed Types**: For efficient numeric computations
3. **Memory Pools**: For packet buffer management
4. **Lock-Free Data Structures**: For concurrent packet queues

## Notes

These features would make FluentAI more suitable for systems programming and network analysis tasks. The current implementation works around these limitations but would benefit significantly from native support.

ClaudeScope demonstrates that even without these features, FluentAI's contract system provides significant value for building reliable network security tools. The ability to formally specify and verify security properties at compile time is a major advantage over traditional approaches.
