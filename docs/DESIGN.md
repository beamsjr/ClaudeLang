# FluentAI Design Document

## Executive Summary

FluentAI is an AI-first programming language that prioritizes machine understanding while maintaining human readability. Unlike traditional languages designed for human cognition, FluentAI optimizes for unambiguous parsing, explicit semantics, and structured representation.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Unambiguous Syntax**: One canonical way to express each concept
2. **Explicit Semantics**: All side effects and dependencies clearly declared
3. **Graph-Based Representation**: Code as directed acyclic graphs
4. **Effect Tracking**: Side effects as first-class citizens
5. **Machine-Readable Documentation**: Structured documentation format

### Trade-offs

**What We Sacrifice:**
- Syntactic sugar and brevity
- Multiple paradigms and styles
- Implicit conversions and coercions

**What We Gain:**
- Perfect static analysis
- Trivial code generation
- Built-in provenance tracking
- Native probabilistic programming

## Architecture

### AST Structure

FluentAI represents programs as graphs of typed nodes:

```python
Graph
├── Nodes (Dict[str, ASTNode])
│   ├── Literal
│   ├── Variable
│   ├── Function
│   ├── Application
│   ├── Lambda
│   ├── Let
│   ├── If
│   ├── Effect
│   ├── Sequence
│   ├── Parallel
│   └── Uncertainty
└── Metadata
```

Each node has:
- Unique ID for reference
- Type annotation
- Effect declaration
- Provenance information

### Type System

The type system includes:

1. **Basic Types**: Int, Float, String, Bool, Unit
2. **Compound Types**: Function, Tuple, List, Record, Variant
3. **Effect Types**: Track side effects in the type system
4. **Probabilistic Types**: Uncertainty with confidence scores
5. **Temporal Types**: Time-bounded computations

### Effect System

Effects are explicit and tracked:

- **PURE**: No side effects
- **IO**: Input/output operations
- **STATE**: Mutable state access
- **ERROR**: Potential failures
- **TIME**: Time-dependent operations
- **NETWORK**: Network operations
- **RANDOM**: Non-deterministic operations

## Implementation Details

### Parser

S-expression syntax maps directly to AST:

```clojure
(+ 1 2) → Application(Function("+"), [Literal(1), Literal(2)])
```

### Interpreter

Graph-based execution with:
- Effect handlers for controlled side effects
- Provenance tracking for debugging
- Parallel evaluation support

### Type Checker

Bidirectional type checking with:
- Type inference for convenience
- Effect inference and checking
- Exhaustiveness checking

## AI Integration

### Code Generation

AI systems can generate FluentAI by:
1. Building AST nodes programmatically
2. Using template-based generation
3. Constraint-based synthesis

### Code Analysis

Perfect static analysis enables:
- Effect analysis
- Complexity analysis
- Pattern detection
- Security verification

### Documentation

Machine-readable documentation includes:
- Formal specifications
- Executable examples
- Performance characteristics
- Cross-references

## Example: Factorial Function

```clojure
(define factorial
  :type (-> Int Int)
  :effects #{:pure}
  :doc {:summary "Computes factorial of n"
        :examples [{:input 5 :output 120}]}
  (lambda (n)
    (if (<= n 1)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))
```

This compiles to:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "factorial",
  "signature": {
    "inputs": [{"name": "n", "type": "Int"}],
    "output": {"type": "Int"},
    "effects": ["PURE"]
  },
  "implementation": {
    "type": "lambda",
    "body": {
      "type": "if",
      "condition": {"type": "<=", "args": ["n", 1]},
      "then": 1,
      "else": {"type": "*", "args": ["n", {"type": "factorial", "args": ["-", "n", 1]}]}
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Extensions

1. **Compilation**: Generate efficient code for multiple targets
2. **Verification**: Formal verification of properties
3. **Synthesis**: Generate code from specifications
4. **Distribution**: Built-in support for distributed computing
5. **Versioning**: Language-level version control

## Conclusion

FluentAI demonstrates how a programming language designed for AI can maintain human usability while providing unprecedented capabilities for automated reasoning, transformation, and generation. By making all implicit concepts explicit and choosing consistency over convenience, we enable a new paradigm of AI-assisted programming.
