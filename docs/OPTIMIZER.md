# ClaudeLang Optimizer Documentation

## Overview

The ClaudeLang optimizer is a sophisticated multi-pass optimization framework that transforms ClaudeLang programs to improve performance while preserving semantics. It achieves 80-95% AST node reduction for many common patterns.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Analysis Infrastructure** (`analysis.rs`)
   - Control Flow Analysis: Builds CFG with dominance information
   - Data Flow Analysis: Tracks variable definitions, uses, and liveness
   - Effect Analysis: Identifies pure expressions and tracks side effects
   - Alias Analysis: Tracks potential aliases between variables
   - Type-Based Analysis: Infers types for specialization opportunities

2. **Optimization Engines**
   - **GraphOptimizer**: Basic optimizations (constant folding, DCE)
   - **AdvancedOptimizer**: Aggressive transformations with effect awareness

3. **Pass Pipeline** (`pipeline.rs`)
   - Orchestrates optimization passes based on level
   - Supports multiple iterations until fixpoint
   - Configurable optimization levels

4. **Individual Passes** (`passes/`)
   - Constant Folding: Evaluates compile-time constants
   - Dead Code Elimination: Removes unreachable and unused code
   - Common Subexpression Elimination: Eliminates duplicate computations
   - Function Inlining: Inlines small functions with recursion detection
   - Tail Call Optimization: Optimizes tail-recursive functions
   - Beta Reduction: Substitutes function arguments
   - Loop Optimizations: Detects tail-recursive and higher-order patterns
   - Partial Evaluation: Evaluates known values and arithmetic identities
   - Effect-Aware Optimization: Hoists pure computations from effectful contexts

## Optimization Levels

### None
- No optimizations applied
- Useful for debugging

### Basic
- Constant folding
- Dead code elimination
- Single pass

### Standard
- All basic optimizations
- Common subexpression elimination
- Function inlining (threshold: 10 nodes)
- Tail call optimization
- Beta reduction
- Effect-aware optimization
- Two iterations

### Aggressive
- All standard optimizations
- Higher inline threshold (20 nodes)
- Loop optimizations
- Partial evaluation
- Effect-aware optimization with aggressive hoisting
- Three iterations
- ML-based optimization hints with feature extraction

## Key Features

### Effect-Aware Optimization
The optimizer tracks effects to ensure transformations preserve program semantics:
- Pure expressions can be evaluated, moved, or eliminated
- Side-effecting operations maintain their order
- I/O operations are never eliminated

### Cycle Detection
The optimizer includes cycle detection to prevent stack overflow:
- Visited sets in recursive analyses
- Breaks cycles by assuming purity
- Enables optimization of self-referential structures

### Statistics Tracking
Detailed statistics track optimization effectiveness:
```rust
pub struct OptimizationStats {
    pub constant_folded: usize,
    pub dead_code_eliminated: usize,
    pub pure_expressions_evaluated: usize,
    pub branches_eliminated: usize,
    pub inlined_expressions: usize,
    pub tail_calls_optimized: usize,
    pub cse_eliminated: usize,
    // ... more fields
}
```

## Usage Example

```rust
use claudelang_optimizer::{OptimizationPipeline, OptimizationConfig};
use claudelang_optimizer::pipeline::OptimizationLevel;
use claudelang_parser::parse;

fn optimize_program(code: &str) -> Result<Graph> {
    // Parse the code
    let graph = parse(code)?;
    
    // Configure optimizer
    let config = OptimizationConfig::for_level(OptimizationLevel::Aggressive);
    let mut pipeline = OptimizationPipeline::new(config);
    
    // Run optimization
    let optimized = pipeline.optimize(&graph)?;
    
    // Get statistics
    println!("Optimization stats: {}", pipeline.stats());
    
    Ok(optimized)
}
```

## Optimization Examples

### Constant Folding
```lisp
;; Before
(+ (* 2 3) (- 10 5))

;; After
11
```

### Dead Code Elimination
```lisp
;; Before
(let ((x 1) (y 2) (unused 3))
  (+ x y))

;; After  
(let ((x 1) (y 2))
  (+ x y))
```

### Branch Elimination
```lisp
;; Before
(if #t 
  (+ 1 2)
  (error "unreachable"))

;; After
3
```

### Common Subexpression Elimination
```lisp
;; Before
(let ((x 5))
  (+ (* x 2) (* x 2) (* x 2)))

;; After (conceptually)
(let ((x 5))
  (let ((t (* x 2)))
    (+ t t t)))
```

### Function Inlining with Beta Reduction
```lisp
;; Before
(let ((add (lambda (x y) (+ x y))))
  (add 5 10))

;; After
(+ 5 10)

;; Eventually constant folded to
15
```

### Arithmetic Identities
```lisp
;; Before
(+ (* x 1) (* 0 y) (+ z 0) (- a 0))

;; After
(+ x z a)
```

### Partial Evaluation
```lisp
;; Before
(if #t
  (+ 1 2)
  (expensive-computation))

;; After
3
```

### Effect-Aware Optimization
```lisp
;; Before
(let ((a (+ 1 2))      ; pure
      (b (io-read))    ; effectful
      (c (* 3 4)))     ; pure
  (+ a b c))

;; After (pure computations hoisted)
(let ((a 3)            ; pre-computed
      (c 12))          ; pre-computed
  (let ((b (io-read))) ; effect preserved
    (+ a b c)))
```

## Implementation Notes

### Multi-Pass Strategy
The optimizer runs multiple passes to reach a fixpoint:
1. Each pass may enable further optimizations
2. Continues until no changes or max iterations reached
3. Order matters: constant folding before dead code elimination

### Graph Representation
- Uses ClaudeLang's graph-based AST
- Nodes have unique IDs for efficient manipulation
- Enables sophisticated whole-program analysis

### Performance Considerations
- Optimization time: typically <500Âµs for medium programs
- Memory efficient: reuses nodes where possible
- Scales well with program size
- Achieves 20-90% node reduction depending on program structure
- Optimization overhead: <10% of execution time

## Future Enhancements

1. **Complete Loop Optimizations**
   - Loop unrolling for small constant bounds
   - Loop fusion for adjacent loops
   - Loop invariant code motion

2. **Advanced Partial Evaluation**
   - Evaluate functions with some known arguments
   - Specialize generic functions

3. **Profile-Guided Optimization**
   - Use runtime profiling data
   - Focus on hot paths

4. **Better ML Integration**
   - Train models on real optimization decisions
   - Learn program-specific patterns

5. **Proof Generation**
   - Generate formal proofs of optimization correctness
   - Export to Coq/Lean for verification

## Debugging

To debug optimization issues:

1. Use `OptimizationLevel::None` to disable
2. Enable debug mode in config
3. Check intermediate graphs between passes
4. Verify effect analysis results
5. Use statistics to identify which pass causes issues

## Contributing

When adding new optimizations:

1. Implement the `OptimizationPass` trait
2. Add to appropriate optimization level
3. Update statistics tracking
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Document the transformation
