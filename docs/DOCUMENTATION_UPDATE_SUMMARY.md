# Documentation Update Summary

This document summarizes the updates made to the documentation after moving files to the docs folder.

## Fixed Links

1. **tutorial.md**:
   - Fixed: `./language_spec.md` → `./LANGUAGE_SPECIFICATION.md`
   - Fixed: `../stdlib/` → `../src/stdlib/`

2. **QUICK_START.md**:
   - Fixed: `OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` → `OPTIMIZATION_JOURNEY.md`

## Updated Implementation Status

1. **tutorial.md**:
   - Pattern Matching: Changed from "Pattern Matching (Future)" to "Pattern Matching" (now implemented)

2. **MODULE_SYSTEM.md**:
   - Import renaming: Removed "(planned feature)" comment (now implemented)

## Verified Correct Paths

The following paths were verified to be correct:
- `../examples/` - Points to the examples directory one level up
- `../src/` - Points to the source directory one level up
- Repository URL: https://github.com/beamsjr/FluentAI (correct)

## Implementation Status Summary

Based on the codebase analysis:
- ✅ Pattern matching is fully implemented (test files exist in rust/examples/)
- ✅ Import renaming is implemented (found in module_system.py)
- ✅ Bytecode compilation is implemented and documented
- ✅ Rust implementation includes VM, parser, compiler, and standard library

## Python Module Paths

The documentation correctly shows Python module imports as:
- `from src.parser import parse`
- `from src.interpreter import Interpreter`
- `python -m src.repl`

These paths are correct for running from the repository root.

## No Action Needed

The following were checked and found to be correct:
- Repository URL in PUSH_SUMMARY.md
- Bytecode compilation documentation in QUICK_START.md
- All external path references (../examples/, ../src/)
