# ClaudeLang Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks

### High Priority ✅
1. **Pull latest changes and verify build** - Successfully synchronized with repository
2. **Implement proper effect tracking in interpreter** - Added comprehensive effect tracking with stack-based system
3. **Fix reactive system integration in UI components** - Fixed handler ordering and integrated reactive effects
4. **Improve garbage collector implementation** - Implemented generational GC with write barriers and concurrent marking
5. **Add network security and sandboxing** - Implemented capability-based security with resource limits and sandboxing

### Medium Priority ✅
6. **Complete contract system and proof generation** 
   - Implemented SMT solver integration (with Z3 support)
   - Added symbolic execution engine
   - Created bounded model checking
   - Enhanced proof verification with multiple strategies
7. **Complete ML optimization pipeline**
   - ML optimization hints system working
   - Fallback to heuristics when scikit-learn not available
   - Feature extraction and pattern learning implemented
8. **Fix import and module export issues**
   - Added missing `resolve_qualified` method to ModuleResolver
   - Created stdlib modules directory
   - All module system tests passing

## Pending Tasks

### Medium Priority

- Sandboxed execution environments
- Network security with domain whitelisting

### Module System
- Module loading with dependency resolution
- Import/export mechanism
- Circular dependency detection
- Standard library module structure
